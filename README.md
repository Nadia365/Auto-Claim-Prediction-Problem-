# Auto-Claim-Prediction-Problem-
In this challenge, we are asked to build a classifcation model. Without further context, we are given some features with continuous values to predict a binary target. This way, we can practice on focussing on the data without requiring any specific domain knowledge because the column names cont# do not indicate any further information.

There is no missing data but instead we have a different obstacle that we have to overcome - imbalanced distribution of the target variable and multimodal distributions of the features.
